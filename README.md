### Getting started

> Make sure you have node.js downloaded on your device; download link - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

> Before you follow the steps below, make sure you have the
[Lightning-CLI](https://rdkcentral.github.io/Lightning-CLI/#/) installed _globally_ only your system

```
npm install -g @lightningjs/cli
```
> Check the install was successful by running `lng -V` to see the version of Lightning that was installed

#### Running the App

1. Install the NPM dependencies by running `npm install`

2. Build the App using the _Lightning-CLI_ by running `lng build` inside the root of your project

3. Fire up a local webserver and open the App in a browser by running `lng serve` inside the root of your project

#### Developing the App

During development you can use the **watcher** functionality of the _Lightning-CLI_.

- use `lng watch` to automatically _rebuild_ your App whenever you make a change in the `src` or  `static` folder
- use `lng dev` to start the watcher and run a local webserver / open the App in a browser _at the same time_

#### Documentation

Use `lng docs` to open up the Lightning-SDK documentation.
